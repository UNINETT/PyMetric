Just install the python-networkx package, and make sure the Python TK
bindings, NumPy and Matplotlib are all installed. The readline python
module is also needed.

Matplotlib must support the TkAgg backend, that is be built against
Tk/Tkinter.


On Debian/Ubuntu, just do

  sudo apt-get install python-networkx python-tk python-matplotlib python-numpy

And you should be good to go.

Note: As it *requires* python-networkx version 0.36, you cant use the
standard Hardy (8.04) packages..

The intrepid package (8.10) should work, you can find it here:
http://launchpadlibrarian.net/14321890/python-networkx_0.36-2_all.deb

For proper alpha-blended edges the Tk version should be >= 8.5, though
this is not *required*

Just run metrics.py, giving it a topology-file (etwas.net) as input.

The file should look like this:

*Network networkname
*Vertices 2
1 "A"   2.0  2.0   (area "optional routing area")
2 "B"   5.0  5.0
*Arcs
1  2  10 (l "optional label")
2  1  10
