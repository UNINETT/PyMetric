PyMetric has the following dependencies:

* NetworkX (http://networkx.lanl.gov/)
* Matplotlib (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/) with TkAgg backend support.
* Python TK-bindings
* Python Readline support

On Debian/Ubuntu, just do

  sudo apt-get install python-networkx python-tk python-matplotlib

On NetBSD use the following packages:

  math/py-networkx
  x11/py-Tk
  math/py-matplotlib
  math/py-matplotlib-tk
  devel/py-readline

Note: Starting with the 0.8 release PyMetric *requires* NetworkX
version >=1.00rc1, if your distro doesn't have a new enough package,
either build one yourself, or use easy_install:

 $ easy_install install networkx

For proper alpha-blended edges the Tk version should be >= 8.5, though
this is not *required*

To install, extract the source to a suitable directory, there is no
real install script at the moment. Just run metrics.py, giving it a
topology-file (etwas.net) as input, or look at the supplied 'pymetric'
startup shell script. This could be adapted and linked to
/usr/bin/pymetric, should you wish to do a multi-user install.

An example configuration file is supplied as well
(pymetricrc.example). The per-user configuration file is .pymetricrc.

The .net-model file should look like this:

*Network networkname
*Vertices 2
1 "A"   2.0  2.0   (area "optional routing area")
2 "B"   5.0  5.0
*Arcs
1  2  10 (l "optional label") (c optional capacity)
2  1  10
