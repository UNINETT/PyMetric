PyMetric is a network simulation and visualisation tool. It
allows the user to trace paths through his network, given a
set of nodes and links with metrics (costs).

It allows the simulation of metric changes, router failures and
link outages, and provides various information relating to the
changes in topology and routing.

PyMetric can also show various statistics on the topology, such
as equal-cost paths, links with assymetric costs, longest paths
and lots more. It can even suggest some metric changes to help
the user with traffic engineering.

PyMetric should perform its job regardless of the routing protocol
used (as long as it is a LSP).
